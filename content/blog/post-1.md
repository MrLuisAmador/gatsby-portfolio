## What are the two language purposes?

After several years of web development. I’ve decided to compare JavaScript and PHP head to head. I will try to outline its comparison on a side by side outline, in an effort to truly understand how each work, and how they differ from each other. Both these languages can be used for more, but I’m only going to focus on what they are mostly used for. JavaScript for the browsers, and PHP for servers. As my understanding of each language grows stronger, I will keep updating each section.

**What is JavaScript?**

JavaScript is an interpreted or JIT-( just in time ) compiled scripting language. It’s used on the client side. This means your browser is executing the Javascript in real time when you load up the page.

**What is PHP?**

PHP is a server-side scripting language. You need to run the web server, with a connected PHP installation. The PHP parser ( CGI or server module ).

**What is JavaScript used for?**

JavaScript can be used to program how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an event. It is also used for controlling web page behavior.

**What is PHP used for?**

PHP can do anything any other CGI program can do, such as collect form data, generate dynamic page content, or send and receive cookies. It’s mostly used to connect to a database in the format of a CRUD ( create, read, update and delete ) application.

**What coding paradigms does JavaScript support?**

This in its simple form just means, what style can I write my code in? JavaScript is a prototype-based language, but it has multi-paradigms. It supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

**What coding paradigms does PHP support?**

PHP main paradigms are procedural and object-oriented styles.
